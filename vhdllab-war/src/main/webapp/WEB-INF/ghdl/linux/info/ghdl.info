1.1 Content of this manual
==========================

This manual is the user and reference manual for GHDL.  It does not
contain an introduction to VHDL.  Thus, the reader should have at least
a basic knowledge of VHDL.  A good knowledge of VHDL language reference
manual (usually called LRM) is a plus.

1.2 What is `VHDL'?
===================

"VHDL" is an acronym for Very High Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware
Description Language which is a programming language used to describe a
logic circuit by function, data flow behaviour, or structure.

   `VHDL' _is_ a programming language: although `VHDL' was not designed
for writing general purpose programs, you can write any algorithm with
the `VHDL' language.  If you are able to write programs, you will find
in `VHDL' features similar to those found in procedural languages such
as `C', `Pascal' or `Ada'.  `VHDL' derives most of its syntax and
semantics from `Ada'.  Knowing `Ada' is an advantage for learning
`VHDL' (it is an advantage in general as well).

   However, `VHDL' was not designed as a general purpose language but
as an `HDL' (hardware description language).  As the name implies,
`VHDL' aims at modeling or documenting electronics systems.  Due to the
nature of hardware components which are always running, `VHDL' is a
highly concurrent language, built upon an event-based timing model.

   Like a program written in any other language, a `VHDL' program can
be executed. Since `VHDL' is used to model designs, the term
"simulation" is often used instead of "execution", with the same
meaning.

   Like a program written in another hardware description language, a
`VHDL' program can be transformed with a `synthesis tool' into a
netlist, that is, a detailed gate-level implementation.


File: ghdl.info,  Node: What is GHDL,  Prev: What is VHDL,  Up: Introduction

1.3 What is `GHDL'?
===================

"GHDL" is a shorthand for G Hardware Design Language.  Currently, `G'
has no meaning.

   "GHDL" is a `VHDL' compiler that can execute (nearly) any `VHDL'
program. `GHDL' is _not_ a synthesis tool: you cannot create a netlist
with `GHDL'.

   Unlike some other simulators, `GHDL' is a compiler: it directly
translates a `VHDL' file to machine code, using the `GCC' back-end and
without using an intermediary language such as `C' or `C++'.
Therefore, the compiled code should be faster and the analysis time
should be shorter than with a compiler using an intermediary language.

   The Windows(TM) version of `GHDL' is not based on `GCC' but on an
internal code generator.

   The current version of `GHDL' does not contain any graphical viewer:
you cannot see signal waves.  You can still check with a test bench.
The current version can produce a `VCD' file which can be viewed with a
wave viewer, as well as `ghw' files to be viewed by `gtkwave'.

   `GHDL' aims at implementing `VHDL' as defined by IEEE 1076.  It
supports most of the 1987 standard and most features added by the 1993
standard.

2 Starting with GHDL
********************

In this chapter, you will learn how to use the GHDL compiler by working
on two examples.

* Menu:

* The hello word program::
* A full adder::
* Starting with a design::


File: ghdl.info,  Node: The hello word program,  Next: A full adder,  Prev: Starting with GHDL,  Up: Starting with GHDL

2.1 The hello world program
===========================

To illustrate the large purpose of VHDL, here is a commented VHDL
"Hello world" program.

     --  Hello world program.
     use std.textio.all; --  Imports the standard textio package.

     --  Defines a design entity, without any ports.
     entity hello_world is
     end hello_world;

     architecture behaviour of hello_world is
     begin
        process
           variable l : line;
        begin
           write (l, String'("Hello world!"));
           writeline (output, l);
           wait;
        end process;
     end behaviour;

   Suppose this program is contained in the file `hello.vhdl'.  First,
you have to compile the file; this is called "analysis" of a design
file in VHDL terms.
     $ ghdl -a hello.vhdl
   This command creates or updates a file `work-obj93.cf', which
describes the library `work'.  On GNU/Linux, this command generates a
file `hello.o', which is the object file corresponding to your VHDL
program.  The object file is not created on Windows.

   Then, you have to build an executable file.
     $ ghdl -e hello_world
   The `-e' option means "elaborate".  With this option, `GHDL' creates
code in order to elaborate a design, with the `hello' entity at the top
of the hierarchy.

   On GNU/Linux, the result is an executable program called `hello'
which can be run:
     $ ghdl -r hello_world
   or directly:
     $ ./hello_world

   On Windows, no file is created.  The simulation is launched using
this command:
     > ghdl -r hello_world

   The result of the simulation appears on the screen:
     Hello world!

2.2 A full adder
================

VHDL is generally used for hardware design.  This example starts with a
full adder described in the `adder.vhdl' file:

     entity adder is
       -- I0, I1 and the carry-in CI are inputs of the adder.
       -- S is the sum output, CO is the carry-out.
       port (i0, i1 : in bit; ci : in bit; s : out bit; co : out bit);
     end adder;

     architecture rtl of adder is
     begin
        --  This full-adder architecture contains two concurrent assignment.
        --  Compute the sum.
        s <= i0 xor i1 xor ci;
        --  Compute the carry.
        co <= (i0 and i1) or (i0 and ci) or (i1 and ci);
     end rtl;

   You can analyze this design file:
     $ ghdl -a adder.vhdl

   You can try to execute the `adder' design, but this is useless,
since nothing externally visible will happen.  In order to check this
full adder, a testbench has to be run.  This testbench is very simple,
since the adder is also simple: it checks exhaustively all inputs.
Note that only the behaviour is tested, timing constraints are not
checked.  The file `adder_tb.vhdl' contains the testbench for the adder:
     --  A testbench has no ports.
     entity adder_tb is
     end adder_tb;

     architecture behav of adder_tb is
        --  Declaration of the component that will be instantiated.
        component adder
          port (i0, i1 : in bit; ci : in bit; s : out bit; co : out bit);
        end component;
        --  Specifies which entity is bound with the component.
        for adder_0: adder use entity work.adder;
        signal i0, i1, ci, s, co : bit;
     begin
        --  Component instantiation.
        adder_0: adder port map (i0 => i0, i1 => i1, ci => ci,
                                 s => s, co => co);

        --  This process does the real job.
        process
           type pattern_type is record
              --  The inputs of the adder.
              i0, i1, ci : bit;
              --  The expected outputs of the adder.
              s, co : bit;
           end record;
           --  The patterns to apply.
           type pattern_array is array (natural range <>) of pattern_type;
           constant patterns : pattern_array :=
             (('0', '0', '0', '0', '0'),
              ('0', '0', '1', '1', '0'),
              ('0', '1', '0', '1', '0'),
              ('0', '1', '1', '0', '1'),
              ('1', '0', '0', '1', '0'),
              ('1', '0', '1', '0', '1'),
              ('1', '1', '0', '0', '1'),
              ('1', '1', '1', '1', '1'));
        begin
           --  Check each pattern.
           for i in patterns'range loop
              --  Set the inputs.
              i0 <= patterns(i).i0;
              i1 <= patterns(i).i1;
              ci <= patterns(i).ci;
              --  Wait for the results.
              wait for 1 ns;
              --  Check the outputs.
              assert s = patterns(i).s
                 report "bad sum value" severity error;
              assert co = patterns(i).co
                 report "bad carray out value" severity error;
           end loop;
           assert false report "end of test" severity note;
           --  Wait forever; this will finish the simulation.
           wait;
        end process;
     end behav;

   As usual, you should analyze the design:
     $ ghdl -a adder_tb.vhdl
   And build an executable for the testbench:
     $ ghdl -e adder_tb
   You do not need to specify which object files are required: GHDL
knows them and automatically adds them in the executable.  Now, it is
time to run the testbench:
     $ ghdl -r adder_tb
     adder_tb.vhdl:52:7:(assertion note): end of test

   If your design is rather complex, you'd like to inspect signals.
Signals value can be dumped using the VCD file format.  The resulting
file can be read with a wave viewer such as GTKWave.  First, you should
simulate your design and dump a waveform file:
     $ ghdl -r adder_tb --vcd=adder.vcd
   Then, you may now view the waves:
     $ gtkwave adder.vcd

   *Note Simulation options::, for more details on the `--vcd' option
and other run time options.

2.3 Starting with a design
==========================

Unless you are only studying VHDL, you will work with bigger designs
than the ones of the previous examples.

   Let's see how to analyze and run a bigger design, such as the DLX
model suite written by Peter Ashenden which is distributed under the
terms of the GNU General Public License.  A copy is kept on
<http://ghdl.free.fr/dlx.tar.gz>

   First, untar the sources:
     $ tar zxvf dlx.tar.gz

   In order not to pollute the sources with the library, it is a good
idea to create a `work/' subdirectory for the `WORK' library.  To any
GHDL commands, we will add the `--workdir=work' option, so that all
files generated by the compiler (except the executable) will be placed
in this directory.
     $ cd dlx
     $ mkdir work

   We will run the `dlx_test_behaviour' design.  We need to analyze all
the design units for the design hierarchy, in the correct order.  GHDL
provides an easy way to do this, by importing the sources:
     $ ghdl -i --workdir=work *.vhdl

   and making a design:
     $ ghdl -m --workdir=work dlx_test_behaviour

   Before this second stage, GHDL knows all the design units of the DLX,
but no one have been analyzed.  The make command of GHDL analyzes and
elaborates a design.  This creates many files in the `work/' directory,
and the `dlx_test_behaviour' executable in the current directory.

   The simulation needs to have a DLX program contained in the file
`dlx.out'.  This memory image will be be loaded in the DLX memory.
Just take one sample:
     $ cp test_loop.out dlx.out

   And you can run the test suite:
     $ ghdl -r dlx_test_behaviour

   The test bench monitors the bus and displays each instruction
executed.  It finishes with an assertion of severity level note:
     dlx-behaviour.vhdl:395:11:(assertion note): TRAP instruction
      encountered, execution halted

   Since the clock is still running, you have to manually stop the
program with the `C-c' key sequence.  This behavior prevents you from
running the test bench in batch mode.  However, you may force the
simulator to stop when an assertion above or equal a certain severity
level occurs:
     $ ghdl -r dlx_test_behaviour --assert-level=note

   With this option, the program stops just after the previous message:
     dlx-behaviour.vhdl:395:11:(assertion note): TRAP instruction
      encountered, execution halted
     error: assertion failed

   If you want to make room on your hard drive, you can either:
   * clean the design library with the GHDL command:
          $ ghdl --clean --workdir=work
     This removes the executable and all the object files.  If you want
     to rebuild the design at this point, just do the make command as
     shown above.

   * remove the design library with the GHDL command:
          $ ghdl --remove --workdir=work
     This removes the executable, all the object files and the library
     file.  If you want to rebuild the design, you have to import the
     sources again, and to make the design.

   * remove the `work/' directory:
          $ rm -rf work
     Only the executable is kept.  If you want to rebuild the design,
     create the `work/' directory, import the sources, and make the
     design.

   Sometimes, a design does not fully follow the VHDL standards.  For
example it uses the badly engineered `std_logic_unsigned' package.
GHDL supports this VHDL dialect through some options:
     --ieee=synopsys -fexplicit

3 Invoking GHDL
***************

The form of the `ghdl' command is

     $ ghdl COMMAND [OPTIONS...]

   The GHDL program has several commands.  The first argument selects
the commands.  The options are used to slighly modify the action.

   No options are allowed before the command.  Except for the run
commands, no options are allowed after a filename or a unit name.

3.1 Building commands
=====================

The mostly used commands of GHDL are those to analyze and elaborate a
design.

* Menu:

* Analysis command::
* Elaboration command::
* Run command::
* Elaborate and run command::
* Bind command::
* Link command::
* List link command::
* Check syntax command::
* Analyze and elaborate command::


File: ghdl.info,  Node: Analysis command,  Next: Elaboration command,  Prev: Building commands,  Up: Building commands

3.1.1 Analysis command
----------------------

     $ ghdl -a [OPTIONS] FILES

   The "analysis" command compiles one or more files, and creates an
object file for each source file.  The analysis command is selected with
-A switch.  Any argument starting with a dash is a option, the others
are filenames.  No options are allowed after a filename argument. GHDL
analyzes each filename in the given order, and stops the analysis in
case of error (the following files are not analyzed).

   *Note GHDL options::, for details on the GHDL options.  For example,
to produce debugging information such as line numbers, use:

     $ ghdl -a -g my_design.vhdl


File: ghdl.info,  Node: Elaboration command,  Next: Run command,  Prev: Analysis command,  Up: Building commands

3.1.2 Elaboration command
-------------------------

     $ ghdl -e [OPTIONS] PRIMARY_UNIT [SECONDARY_UNIT]

   On GNU/Linux the "elaboration" command creates an executable
containing the code of the `VHDL' sources, the elaboration code and
simulation code to execute a design hiearachy. On Windows this command
elaborates the design but does not generate anything.

   The elaboration command is selected with -E switch, and must be
followed by either:

   * a name of a configuration unit

   * a name of an entity unit

   * a name of an entity unit followed by a name of an architecture unit

   Name of the units must be a simple name, without any dot.  You can
select the name of the `WORK' library with the `--work=NAME' option, as
described in *Note GHDL options::.

   *Note Top entity::, for the restrictions on the root design of a
hierarchy.

   On GNU/Linux the file name of the executable is the name of the
primary unit, or for the later case, the concatenation of the name of
the primary unit, a dash, and the name of the secondary unit (or
architecture).  On Windows there is no executable generated.

   The `-o' followed by a file name can override the default executable
file name.

   For the elaboration command, `GHDL' re-analyzes all the
configurations, entities, architectures and package declarations, and
creates the default configurations and the default binding indications
according to the LRM rules.  It also generates the list of objects files
required for the executable.  Then, it links all these files with the
run time library.

   The actual elaboration is performed at run-time.

   On Windows this command can be skipped because it is also done by the
run command.


File: ghdl.info,  Node: Run command,  Next: Elaborate and run command,  Prev: Elaboration command,  Up: Building commands

3.1.3 Run command
-----------------

Run (or simulate) a design.

     $ ghdl -r [OPTIONS] PRIMARY_UNIT [SECONDARY_UNIT] [SIMULATION_OPTIONS]

   The options and arguments are the same as the *Note Elaboration
command::.

   On GNU/Linux this command simply build the filename of the executable
and execute it.  Options are ignored. You may also directly execute the
program.

   This command exists for three reasons:
   * You don't have to create the executable program name.

   * It is coherent with the `-a' and `-e' commands.

   * It works with the Windows implementation, where the code is
     generated in memory.

   On Windows this command elaborate and launch the simulation.  As a
consequence you must use the same options used during analysis.

   *Note Simulation and run time::, for details on options.


File: ghdl.info,  Node: Elaborate and run command,  Next: Bind command,  Prev: Run command,  Up: Building commands

3.1.4 Elaborate and run command
-------------------------------

Elaborate and then simulate a design unit.

     $ ghdl --elab-run [ELAB_OPTIONS] PRIMARY_UNIT [SECONDARY_UNIT] [RUN_OPTIONS]

   This command acts like the elaboration command (*note Elaboration
command::) followed by the run command (*note Run command::).


File: ghdl.info,  Node: Bind command,  Next: Link command,  Prev: Elaborate and run command,  Up: Building commands

3.1.5 Bind command
------------------

Bind a design unit and prepare the link step.

     $ ghdl --bind [OPTIONS] PRIMARY_UNIT [SECONDARY_UNIT]

   This command is only available on GNU/Linux.

   This performs only the first stage of the elaboration command; the
list of objects files is created but the executable is not built.  This
command should be used only when the main entry point is not ghdl.


File: ghdl.info,  Node: Link command,  Next: List link command,  Prev: Bind command,  Up: Building commands

3.1.6 Link command
------------------

Link an already bound design unit.

     $ ghdl --link [OPTIONS] PRIMARY_UNIT [SECONDARY_UNIT]

   This performs only the second stage of the elaboration command: the
executable is created by linking the files of the object files list.
This command is available only for completness.  The elaboration
command is equivalent to the bind command followed by the link command.


File: ghdl.info,  Node: List link command,  Next: Check syntax command,  Prev: Link command,  Up: Building commands

3.1.7 List link command
-----------------------

Disp files which will be linked.

     $ ghdl --list-link PRIMARY_UNIT [SECONDARY_UNIT]

   This command is only available on GNU/Linux.

   This command may be used only after a bind command.  GHDL displays
all the files which will be linked to create an executable.  This
command is intended to add object files in a link of an foreign program.


File: ghdl.info,  Node: Check syntax command,  Next: Analyze and elaborate command,  Prev: List link command,  Up: Building commands

3.1.8 Check syntax command
--------------------------

Analyze files but do not generate code.

     $ ghdl -s [OPTIONS] FILES

   This command may be used to check the syntax of files.  It does not
update the library.


File: ghdl.info,  Node: Analyze and elaborate command,  Prev: Check syntax command,  Up: Building commands

3.1.9 Analyze and elaborate command
-----------------------------------

Analyze files and elaborate in the same time.

   On GNU/Linux:
     $ ghdl -c [OPTIONS] FILE... -e PRIMARY_UNIT [SECONDARY_UNIT]

   On Windows:
     $ ghdl -c [OPTIONS] FILE... -r PRIMARY_UNIT [SECONDARY_UNIT]

   This command combines analyze and elaboration: FILEs are analyzed and
the unit is then elaborated.  However, code is only generated during the
elaboration.  On Windows the simulation is launched.

   To be more precise, the files are first parsed, and then the
elaboration drives the analysis.  Therefore, there is no analysis
order, and you don't need to care about it.

   All the units of the files are put into the `work' library.  But, the
work library is neither read from disk nor saved.  Therefore, you must
give all the files of the `work' library your design needs.

   The advantages over the traditionnal approach (analyze and then
elaborate) are:
   * The compilation cycle is achieved in one command.

   * Since the files are only parsed once, the compilation cycle may be
     faster.

   * You don't need to know an analysis order

   * This command produces smaller executable, since unused units and
     subprograms do not generate code.
   However, you should know that currently most of the time is spent in
code generation and the analyze and elaborate command generate code for
all units needed, even units of `std' and `ieee' libraries.  Therefore,
according to the design, the time for this command may be higher than
the time for the analyze command followed by the elaborate command.

   This command is still experimental.  In case of problems, you should
go back to the traditionnal way.

3.2 GHDL options
================

Besides the options described below, `GHDL' passes any debugging options
(those that begin with `-g') and optimizations options (those that
begin with `-O' or `-f') to `GCC'.  Refer to the `GCC' manual for
details.

`--work=NAME'
     Specify the name of the `WORK' library.  Analyzed units are always
     placed in the library logically named `WORK'.  With this option,
     you can set its name.  By default, the name is WORK.

     `GHDL' checks `WORK' is a valid identifier.  Although being more
     or less supported, the `WORK' identifier should not be an extended
     identifier, since the filesystem may prevent it from correctly
     working (due to case sensitivity or forbidden characters in
     filenames).

     `VHDL' rules forbides you to add units in the `std' library.
     Furthermode, you should not put units in the `ieee' library.

`--workdir=DIR'
     Specify the directory where the `WORK' library is.  When this
     option is not present, the `WORK' library is in the current
     directory.  The object files created by the compiler are always
     placed in the same directory as the `WORK' library.

     Use option `-P' to specify where libraries other than `WORK' are
     placed.

`--std=STD'
     Specify the standard to use.  By default, the standard is `93c',
     which means VHDL-93 accepting VHDL-87 syntax.  For details on STD
     values see *Note VHDL standards::.

`--ieee=VER'
     Select the `IEEE' library to use. VER must be one of:

    `none'
          Do not supply an `IEEE' library.  Any library clause with the
          `IEEE' identifier will fail, unless you have created by your
          own a library with the `IEEE' name.

    `standard'
          Supply an `IEEE' library containing only packages defined by
          IEEE standards.  Currently, there are the multivalue logic
          system packages `std_logic_1164' defined by IEEE 1164, the
          synthesis packages , `numeric_bit' and `numeric_std' defined
          by IEEE 1076.3, and the VITAL packages `vital_timing' and
          `vital_primitives', defined by IEEE 1076.4.  The version of
          these packages is defined by the VHDL standard used.  *Note
          VITAL packages::, for more details.

    `synopsys'
          Supply the former packages and the following additionnal
          packages: `std_logic_arith', `std_logic_signed',
          `std_logic_unsigned', `std_logic_textio'.  These packages
          were created by some companies, and are popular.  However
          they are not standard packages, and have been placed in the
          `IEEE' library without the IEEE permission.

    `mentor'
          Supply the standardr packages and the following additionnal
          package: `std_logic_arith'.  The package is a slight
          variation on a definitly not standard but widely mis-used
          package.

     To avoid errors, you must use the same `IEEE' library for all
     units of your design, and during elaboration.

`-PDIRECTORY'
     Add DIRECTORY to the end of the list of directories to be searched
     for library files.

     The `WORK' library is always searched in the path specified by the
     `--workdir=' option, or in the current directory if the later
     option is not specified.

`-fexplicit'
     When two operators are overloaded, give preference to the explicit
     declaration.  This may be used to avoid the most common pitfall of
     the `std_logic_arith' package.  *Note IEEE library pitfalls::, for
     an example.

     This option is not set by default.  I don't think this option is a
     good feature, because it breaks the encapsulation rule.  When set,
     an operator can be silently overriden in another package.  You'd
     better to fix your design and use the `numeric_std' package.

`--no-vital-checks'

`--vital-checks'
     Disable or enable checks of restriction on VITAL units.  Checks
     are enabled by default.

     Checks are performed only when a design unit is decorated by a
     VITAL attribute.  The VITAL attributes are `VITAL_Level0' and
     `VITAL_Level1', both declared in the `ieee.VITAL_Timing' package.

     Currently, VITAL checks are only partially implemented.  *Note
     VHDL restrictions for VITAL::, for more details.

`--syn-binding'
     Use synthetizer rules for component binding.  During elaboration,
     if a component is not bound to an entity using VHDL LRM rules, try
     to find in any known library an entity whose name is the same as
     the component name.

     This rule is known as synthetizer rule.

     There are two key points: normal VHDL LRM rules are tried first and
     entities are search only in known library.  A known library is a
     library which has been named in your design.

     This option is only useful during elaboration.

`--PREFIX=PATH'
     Use PATH as the prefix path to find commands and pre-installed
     (std and ieee) libraries.

`--GHDL1=COMMAND'
     Use COMMAND as the command name for the compiler.  If COMMAND is
     not a path, then it is search in the list of program directories.

`-v'
     Be verbose.  For example, for analysis, elaboration and make
     commands, GHDL displays the commands executed.

3.3 Passing options to other programs
=====================================

These options are only available on GNU/Linux.

   For many commands, `GHDL' acts as a driver: it invokes programs to
perform the command.  You can pass arbritrary options to these programs.

   Both the compiler and the linker are in fact GCC programs.  *Note
GCC options: (gcc)Invoking GCC, for details on GCC options.

`-Wc,OPTION'
     Pass OPTION as an option to the compiler.

`-Wa,OPTION'
     Pass OPTION as an option to the assembler.

`-Wl,OPTION'
     Pass OPTION as an option to the linker.


File: ghdl.info,  Node: GHDL warnings,  Next: Rebuilding commands,  Prev: Passing options to other programs,  Up: Invoking GHDL

3.4 GHDL warnings
=================

Some contructions are not erroneous but dubious.  Warnings are
diagnostic messages that report such constructions.  Some warnings are
reported only during analysis, others during elaboration.

   You could disable a warning by using the `--warn-no-XXX' instead of
`--warn-XXX'.

`--warn-reserved'
     Emit a warning if an identifier is a reserved word in a latter
     VHDL standard.

`--warn-default-binding'
     During analyze, warns if a component instantiation has neither
     configuration specification nor default binding.  This may be
     usefull if you want to detect during analyze possibly unbound
     component if you don't use configuration.  *Note VHDL standards::,
     for more details about default binding rules.

`--warn-binding'
     During elaboration, warns if a component instantiation is not bound
     (and not explicitly left unbound).  Also warns if a port of an
     entity is not bound in a configuration specification or in a
     component configuration.  This warning is enabled by default,
     since default binding rules are somewhat complex and an unbound
     component is most often unexpected.

     However, warnings are even emitted if a component instantiation is
     inside a generate statement.  As a consequence, if you use
     conditionnal generate statement to select a component according to
     the implementation, you will certainly get warnings.

`--warn-library'
     Warns if a design unit replaces another design unit with the same
     name.

`--warn-vital-generic'
     Warns if a generic name of a vital entity is not a vital generic
     name.  This is set by default.

`--warn-delayed-checks'
     Warns for checks that cannot be done during analysis time and are
     postponed to elaboration time.  This is because not all procedure
     bodies are available during analysis (either because a package body
     has not yet been analysed or because `GHDL' doesn't read not
     required package bodies).

     These are checks for no wait statement in a procedure called in a
     sensitized process and checks for pure rules of a function.

`--warn-body'
     Emit a warning if a package body which is not required is
     analyzed.  If a package does not declare a subprogram or a
     deferred constant, the package does not require a body.

`--warn-specs'
     Emit a warning if an all or others specification does not apply.

`--warn-unused'
     Emit a warning when a subprogram is never used.

`--warn-error'
     When this option is set, warnings are considered as errors.

3.5 Rebuilding commands
=======================

Analyzing and elaborating a design consisting in severals files can be
tricky, due to dependences.  GHDL has a few commands to rebuild a
design.

* Menu:

* Import command::
* Make command::
* Generate Makefile command::


File: ghdl.info,  Node: Import command,  Next: Make command,  Prev: Rebuilding commands,  Up: Rebuilding commands

3.5.1 Import command
--------------------

Add files in the work design library.

     $ ghdl -i [OPTIONS] FILE...

   All the files specified in the command line are scanned, parsed and
added in the libraries but as not yet analyzed.  No object files are
created.

   The purpose of this command is to localize design units in the
design files.  The make command will then be able to recursively build
a hierarchy from an entity name or a configuration name.

   Since the files are parsed, there must be correct files.  However,
since they are not analyzed, many errors are tolerated by this command.

   Note that all the files are added in the work library.  If you have
many libraries, you must use the command for each library.

   *Note Make command::, to actually build the design.


File: ghdl.info,  Node: Make command,  Next: Generate Makefile command,  Prev: Import command,  Up: Rebuilding commands

3.5.2 Make command
------------------

     $ ghdl -m [OPTIONS] PRIMARY [SECONDARY]

   Analyze automatically outdated files and elaborate a design.

   The primary unit denoted by the PRIMARY argument must already be
known by the system, either because you have already analyzed it (even
if you have modified it) or because you have imported it.  GHDL analyzes
all outdated files.  A file may be outdated because it has been modified
(e.g. you just have edited it), or because a design unit contained in
the file depends on a unit which is outdated.  This rule is of course
recursive.

   With the `-f' (force) option, GHDL analyzes all the units of the
work library needed to create the design hierarchy.  Not outdated units
are recompiled.  This is useful if you want to compile a design hierarch
with new compilation flags (for example, to add the `-g' debugging
option).

   The make command will only re-analyze design units in the work
library.  GHDL fails if it has to analyze an outdated unit from another
library.

   The purpose of this command is to be able to compile a design
without prior knowledge of file order.  In the VHDL model, some units
must be analyzed before others (e.g. an entity before its
architecture).  It might be a nightmare to analyze a full design of
several files, if you don't have the ordered list of file.  This
command computes an analysis order.

   The make command fails when a unit was not previously parsed.  For
example, if you split a file containing several design units into
several files, you must either import these new files or analyze them so
that GHDL knows in which file these units are.

   The make command imports files which have been modified.  Then, a
design hierarchy is internally built as if no units are outdated.
Then, all outdated design units, using the dependences of the design
hierarchy, are analyzed.  If necessary, the design hierarchy is
elaborated.

   This is not perfect, since defaults architecture (the most recently
analyzed one) may change while outdated design files are analyzed. In
such a case, re-run the make command of GHDL.


File: ghdl.info,  Node: Generate Makefile command,  Prev: Make command,  Up: Rebuilding commands

3.5.3 Generate Makefile command
-------------------------------

Generate a Makefile to build a design unit.

     $ ghdl --gen-makefile [OPTIONS] PRIMARY [SECONDARY]

   This command works like the make command (*note Make command::), but
only a makefile is generated on the standard output.

3.6 Library commands
====================

GHDL has a few commands which act on a library.

* Menu:

* Directory command::
* Clean command::
* Remove command::


File: ghdl.info,  Node: Directory command,  Next: Clean command,  Prev: Library commands,  Up: Library commands

3.6.1 Directory command
-----------------------

Display the name of the units contained in a design library.
     $ ghdl -d [OPTIONS]

   The directory command, selected with the -D command line argument
displays the content of the work design library.  All options are
allowed, but only a few are meaningful: `--work=NAME', `--workdir=PATH'
and `--std=VER'.


File: ghdl.info,  Node: Clean command,  Next: Remove command,  Prev: Directory command,  Up: Library commands

3.6.2 Clean command
-------------------

Remove object and executable files but keep the library.

     $ ghdl --clean [OPTIONS]

   GHDL tries to remove any object, executable or temporary file it
could have created.  Source files are not removed.

   There is no short command line form for this option to prevent
accidental clean up.


File: ghdl.info,  Node: Remove command,  Prev: Clean command,  Up: Library commands

3.6.3 Remove command
--------------------

Do like the clean command but remove the library too.

     $ ghdl --remove [OPTIONS]

   There is no short command line form for this option to prevent
accidental clean up.  Note that after removing a design library, the
files are not known anymore by GHDL.


File: ghdl.info,  Node: Cross-reference command,  Next: File commands,  Prev: Library commands,  Up: Invoking GHDL

3.7 Cross-reference command
===========================

To easily navigate through your sources, you may generate
cross-references.

     $ ghdl --xref-html [OPTIONS] FILE...

   This command generates an html file for each FILE given in the
command line, with syntax highlighting and full cross-reference: every
identifier is a link to its declaration.  Besides, an index of the
files is created too.

   The set of FILE are analyzed, and then, if the analyze is
successful, html files are generated in the directory specified by the
`-o DIR' option, or `html/' directory by default.

   If the `--format=html2' is specified, then the generated html files
follow the HTML 2.0 standard, and colours are specified with `<FONT>'
tags.  However, colours are hard-coded.

   If the `--format=css' is specified, then the generated html files
follow the HTML 4.0 standard, and use the CSS-1 file `ghdl.css' to
specify colours.  This file is generated only if it does not already
exist (it is never overwritten) and can be customized by the user to
change colours or appearance.  Refer to a generated file and its
comments for more informations.

3.8 File commands
=================

The following commands act on one or severals files.  They do not
analysis files, therefore, they work even if a file has semantic errors.

* Menu:

* Pretty print command::
* Find command::
* Chop command::
* Lines command::


File: ghdl.info,  Node: Pretty print command,  Next: Find command,  Prev: File commands,  Up: File commands

3.8.1 Pretty print command
--------------------------

Generate HTML on standard output from VHDL.

     $ ghdl --pp-html [OPTIONS] FILE...

   The files are just scanned and an html file, with syntax
highlighting is generated on standard output.

   Since the files are not even parsed, erroneous files or uncomplete
designs can be pretty printed.

   The style of the html file can be modified with the `--format='
option.  By default or when the `--format=html2' option is specified,
the output is an HTML 2.0 file, with colours set throught `<FONT>'
tags.  When the `--format=css' option is specified, the output is an
HTML 4.0 file, with colours set through a CSS file, whose name is
`ghdl.css'.  *Note Cross-reference command::, for more details about
this CSS file.


File: ghdl.info,  Node: Find command,  Next: Chop command,  Prev: Pretty print command,  Up: File commands

3.8.2 Find command
------------------

Display the name of the design units in files.

     $ ghdl -f FILE...

   The files are scanned, parsed and the names of design units are
displayed.  Design units marked with two stars are candidate to be at
the apex of a design hierarchy.


File: ghdl.info,  Node: Chop command,  Next: Lines command,  Prev: Find command,  Up: File commands

3.8.3 Chop command
------------------

Chop (or split) files at design unit.

     $ ghdl --chop FILES

   `GHDL' reads files, and writes a file in the current directory for
every design unit.

   The file name of a design unit is build according to the unit.  For
an entity declaration, a package declaration or a configuration the file
name is `NAME.vhdl', where NAME is the name of the design unit.  For a
package body, the file name is `NAME-body.vhdl'.  Finally, for an
architecture ARCH of an entity ENTITY, the file name is
`ENTITY-ARCH.vhdl'.

   Since the input files are parsed, this command aborts in case of
syntax error.  The command aborts too if a file to be written already
exists.

   Comments between design units are stored into the most adequate
files.

   This command may be useful to split big files, if your computer has
not enough memory to compile such files.  The size of the executable is
reduced too.


File: ghdl.info,  Node: Lines command,  Prev: Chop command,  Up: File commands

3.10 Installation Directory
===========================

During analysis and elaboration `GHDL' may read the `std' and `ieee'
files.  The location of these files is based on the prefix, which is
(in priority order):
  1. the `--PREFIX=' command line option

  2. the GHDL_PREFIX environment variable

  3. a built-in default path.  It is an hard-coded path on GNU/Linux
     and the value of the `HKLM\Software\Ghdl\Install_Dir' registry
     entry on Windows.

   You should use the `--dispconfig' command (*note Dispconfig
command:: for details) to disp and debug installation problems.


File: ghdl.info,  Node: IEEE library pitfalls,  Prev: Installation Directory,  Up: Invoking GHDL

3.11 IEEE library pitfalls
==========================

When you use options `--ieee=synopsys' or `--ieee=mentor', the `IEEE'
library contains non standard packages such as `std_logic_arith'.
These packages are not standard because there are not described by an
IEEE standard, even if they have been put in the `IEEE' library.
Furthermore, they are not really de-facto standard, because there a
slight differences between the packages of Mentor and those of Synopsys.

   Furthermore, since they are not well-thought, their use have
pitfalls.  For example, this description has error during compilation:
     library ieee;
     use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;

     --  A counter from 0 to 10.
     entity counter is
        port (val : out std_logic_vector (3 downto 0);
              ck : std_logic;
              rst : std_logic);
     end counter;

     library ieee;
     use ieee.std_logic_unsigned.all;

     architecture bad of counter
     is
        signal v : std_logic_vector (3 downto 0);
     begin
        process (ck, rst)
        begin
          if rst = '1' then
             v <= x"0";
          elsif rising_edge (ck) then
             if v = "1010" then -- Error
                v <= x"0";
             else
                v <= v + 1;
             end if;
          end if;
        end process;

        val <= v;
     end bad;

   When you analyze this design, GHDL does not accept it (too long lines
have been split for readability):
     $ ghdl -a --ieee=synopsys bad_counter.vhdl
     bad_counter.vhdl:13:14: operator "=" is overloaded
     bad_counter.vhdl:13:14: possible interpretations are:
     ../../libraries/ieee/std_logic_1164.v93:69:5: implicit function "="
         [std_logic_vector, std_logic_vector return boolean]
     ../../libraries/synopsys/std_logic_unsigned.vhdl:64:5: function "="
         [std_logic_vector, std_logic_vector return boolean]
     ../translate/ghdldrv/ghdl: compilation error
   Indeed, the `"="' operator is defined in both packages, and both are
visible at the place it is used.  The first declaration is an implicit
one, which occurs when the `std_logic_vector' type is declared and is a
element to element comparaison, the second one is an explicit declared
function, with the semantic of an unsigned comparaison.

   With some analyser, the explicit declaration has priority on the
implicit declaration, and this design can be analyzed without error.
However, this is not the rule given by the VHDL LRM, and since GHDL
follows these rules, it emits an error.

   You can force GHDL to use this rule with the `-fexplicit' option.
*Note GHDL options::, for more details.

   However it is easy to fix this error, by using a selected name:
     library ieee;
     use ieee.std_logic_unsigned.all;

     architecture fixed_bad of counter
     is
        signal v : std_logic_vector (3 downto 0);
     begin
        process (ck, rst)
        begin
          if rst = '1' then
             v <= x"0";
          elsif rising_edge (ck) then
             if ieee.std_logic_unsigned."=" (v, "1010") then
                v <= x"0";
             else
                v <= v + 1;
             end if;
          end if;
        end process;

        val <= v;
     end fixed_bad;

   It is better to only use the standard packages defined by IEEE, which
provides the same functionnalities:
     library ieee;
     use ieee.numeric_std.all;

     architecture good of counter
     is
        signal v : unsigned (3 downto 0);
     begin
        process (ck, rst)
        begin
          if rst = '1' then
             v <= x"0";
          elsif rising_edge (ck) then
             if v = "1010" then
                v <= x"0";
             else
                v <= v + 1;
             end if;
          end if;
        end process;

        val <= std_logic_vector (v);
     end good;

File: ghdl.info,  Node: Simulation options,  Next: Debugging VHDL programs,  Prev: Simulation and run time,  Up: Simulation and run time

4.1 Simulation options
======================

In most system environments, it is possible to pass options while
invoking a program.  Contrary to most programming language, there is no
standard method in VHDL to obtain the arguments or to set the exit
status.

   In GHDL, it is impossible to pass parameters to your design.  A
later version could do it through the generics interfaces of the top
entity.

   However, the GHDL run time behaviour can be modified with some
options; for example, it is possible to stop simulation after a certain
time.

   The exit status of the simulation is `EXIT_SUCCESS' (0) if the
simulation completes, or `EXIT_FAILURE' (1) in case of error (assertion
failure, overflow or any constraint error).

   Here is the list of the most useful options.  Some debugging options
are also available, but not described here.  The `--help' options lists
all options available, including the debugging one.

`--assert-level=LEVEL'
     Select the assertion level at which an assertion violation stops
     the simulation.  LEVEL is the name from the `severity_level'
     enumerated type defined in the `standard' package or the `none'
     name.

     By default, only assertion violation of severity level `failure'
     stops the simulation.

     For example, if LEVEL was `warning', any assertion violation with
     severity level `warning', `error' or `failure' would stop
     simulation, but the assertion violation at the `note' severity
     level would only display a message.

     `--assert-level=none' prevents any assertion violation to stop
     simulation.

`--ieee-asserts=POLICY'
     Select how the assertions from `ieee' units are handled. POLICY
     can be `enable' (the default), `disable' which disables all
     assertion from `ieee' packages and `disable-at-0' which disables
     only at start of simulation.

     This option can be useful to avoid assertion message from
     `ieee.numeric_std' (and other `ieee' packages).

`--stop-time=TIME'
     Stop the simulation after TIME.  TIME is expressed as a time
     value, _without_ any space.  The time is the simulation time, not
     the real clock time.

     For examples:

          $ ./my_design --stop-time=10ns
          $ ./my_design --stop-time=ps

`--stop-delta=N'
     Stop the simulation after N delta cycles in the same current time.

`--disp-time'
     Display the time and delta cycle number as simulation advances.

`--disp-tree[=KIND]'
     Display the design hierarchy as a tree of instantiated design
     entities.  This may be useful to understand the structure of a
     complex design. KIND is optional, but if set must be one of:
    `none'
          Do not display hierarchy.  Same as if the option was not
          present.

    `inst'
          Display entities, architectures, instances, blocks and
          generates statements.

    `proc'
          Like `inst' but also display processes.

    `port'
          Like `proc' but display ports and signals too.
     If KIND is not specified, the hierarchy is displayed with the
     `port' mode.

`--no-run'
     Do not simulate, only elaborate.  This may be used with
     `--disp-tree' to display the tree without simulating the whole
     design.

`--vcd=FILENAME'

`--vcdgz=FILENAME'
     `--vcd' dumps into the VCD file FILENAME the signal values before
     each non-delta cycle.  If FILENAME is `-', then the standard
     output is used, otherwise a file is created or overwritten.

     The `--vcdgz' option is the same as the `--vcd' option, but the
     output is compressed using the `zlib' (`gzip' compression).
     However, you can't use the `-' filename.  Furthermore, only one
     VCD file can be written.

     "VCD" (value change dump) is a file format defined by the
     `verilog' standard and used by virtually any wave viewer.

     Since it comes from `verilog', only a few VHDL types can be
     dumped.  GHDL dumps only signals whose base type is of the
     following:
        * types defined in the `std.standard' package:
             * `bit'

             * `bit_vector'

        * types defined in the `ieee.std_logic_1164' package:
             * `std_ulogic'

             * `std_logic' (because it is a subtype of `std_ulogic')

             * `std_ulogic_vector'

             * `std_logic_vector'

        * any integer type

     I have successfully used `gtkwave' to view VCD files.

     Currently, there is no way to select signals to be dumped: all
     signals are dumped, which can generate big files.

     It is very unfortunate there is no standard or well-known wave file
     format supporting VHDL types.  If you are aware of such a free
     format, please mail me (*note Reporting bugs::).

`--wave=FILENAME'
     Write the waveforms into a `ghw' (GHdl Waveform) file.  Currently,
     all the signals are dumped into the waveform file, you cannot
     select a hierarchy of signals to be dumped.

     The format of this file was defined by myself and is not yet
     completly fixed.  It may change slightly.

     There is a patch against `gtkwave 1.3.72' on the ghdl website at
     `ghdl.free.fr', so that it can read such files.

     Contrary to VCD files, any VHDL type can be dumped into a GHW file.

`--sdf=PATH=FILENAME'

`--sdf=min=PATH=FILENAME'

`--sdf=typ=PATH=FILENAME'

`--sdf=max=PATH=FILENAME'
     Do VITAL annotation on PATH with SDF file FILENAME.

     PATH is a path of instances, separated with `.' or `/'.  Any
     separator can be used.  Instances are component instantiation
     labels, generate labels or block labels.  Currently, you cannot
     use an indexed name.

     If the option contains a type of delay, that is `min=', `typ=' or
     `max=', the annotator use respectively minimum, typical or maximum
     values.  If the option does not contain a type of delay, the
     annotator use the typical delay.

     *Note Backannotation::, for more details.

`--stack-max-size=SIZE'
     Set the maximum size in bytes of the non-sensitized processes
     stacks.

     If the value SIZE is followed (without any space) by the `k', `K',
     `kb', `Kb', `ko' or `Ko' multiplier, then the size is the numeric
     value multiplied by 1024.

     If the value SIZE is followed (without any space) by the `m', `M',
     `mb', `Mb', `mo' or `Mo' multiplier, then the size is the numeric
     value multiplied by 1024 * 1024 = 1048576.

     Each non-sensitized process has its own stack, while the
     sensitized processes share the same and main stack.  This stack is
     the stack created by the operating system.

     Using too small stacks may result in simulation failure due to
     lack of memory.  Using too big stacks may reduce the maximum
     number of processes.

`--stack-size=SIZE'
     Set the initial size in bytes of the non-sensitized processes
     stack.  The SIZE value has the same format as the previous option.

     The stack of the non-sensitized processes grows until reaching the
     maximum size limit.

`--help'
     Display a short description of the options accepted by the run
     time library.

4.2 Debugging VHDL programs
===========================

Debugging VHDL programs usign `GDB' is possible only on GNU/Linux
systems.

   `GDB' is a general purpose debugger for programs compiled by `GCC'.
Currently, there is no VHDL support for `GDB'.  It may be difficult to
inspect variables or signals in `GDB', however, `GDB' is still able to
display the stack frame in case of error or to set a breakpoint at a
specified line.

   `GDB' can be useful to precisely catch a run-time error, such as
indexing an array beyond its bounds.  All error check subprograms call
the `__ghdl_fatal' procedure.  Therefore, to catch run-time error, set
a breakpoint like this:
     (gdb) break __ghdl_fatal
   When the breakpoint is hit, use the `where' or `bt' command to
display the stack frames.

5.1 VHDL standards
==================

This is very unfortunate, but there are many versions of the VHDL
language.

   The VHDL language was first standardized in 1987 by IEEE as IEEE
1076-1987, and is commonly referred as VHDL-87. This is certainly the
most important version, since most of the VHDL tools are still based on
this standard.

   Various problems of this first standard have been analyzed by
experts groups to give reasonable ways of interpreting the unclear
portions of the standard.

   VHDL was revised in 1993 by IEEE as IEEE 1076-1993.  This revision
is still well-known.

   Unfortunatly, VHDL-93 is not fully compatible with VHDL-87, ie some
perfectly valid VHDL-87 programs are invalid VHDL-93 programs.  Here
are some of the reasons:

   * the syntax of file declaration has changed (this is the most
     visible source of incompatibility),

   * new keywords were introduced (group, impure, inertial, literal,
     postponed, pure, reject, rol, ror, shared, sla, sll, sra, srl,
     unaffected, xnor),

   * some dynamic behaviours have changed (the concatenation is one of
     them),

   * rules have been added.

   Shared variables were replaced by protected types in the 2000
revision of the VHDL standard.  This modification is also known as
1076a.  Note that this standard is not fully backward compatible with
VHDL-93, since the type of a shared variable must now be a protected
type (there was no such restriction before).

   Minors corrections were added by the 2002 revision of the VHDL
standard.  This revision is not fully backward compatible with VHDL-00
since, for example, the value of the `'instance_name' attribute has
slighly changed.

   You can select the VHDL standard expected by GHDL with the
`--std=VER' option, where VER is one of the left column of the table
below:

`87'
     Select VHDL-87 standard as defined by IEEE 1076-1987.  LRM bugs
     corrected by later revisions are taken into account.

`93'
     Select VHDL-93; VHDL-87 file declarations are not accepted.

`93c'
     Select VHDL-93 standard with relaxed rules:
        * VHDL-87 file declarations are accepted;

        * default binding indication rules of VHDL-02 are used.
          Default binding rules are often used, but they are
          particulary obscure before VHDL-02.

`00'
     Select VHDL-2000 standard, which adds protected types.

`02'
     Select VHDL-2002 standard (partially implemented).

   You cannot mix VHDL-87 and VHDL-93 units.  A design hierarchy must
have been completly analyzed using either the 87 or the 93 version of
the VHDL standard.


File: ghdl.info,  Node: Source representation,  Next: Library database,  Prev: VHDL standards,  Up: GHDL implementation of VHDL

5.2 Source representation
=========================

According to the VHDL standard, design units (i.e. entities,
architectures, packages, package bodies and configurations) may be
independently analyzed.

   Several design units may be grouped into a design file.

   In GHDL, a system file represents a design file.  That is, a file
compiled by GHDL may contain one or more design units.

   It is common to have several design units in a design file.

   GHDL does not impose any restriction on the name of a design file
(except that the file name may not contain any control character or
spaces).

   GHDL do not keep a binary representation of the design units
analyzed like other VHDL analyzers.  The sources of the design units
are re-read when needed (for example, an entity is re-read when one of
its architecture is analyzed).  Therefore, if you delete or modify a
source file of a unit analyzed, GHDL will refuse to use it.


File: ghdl.info,  Node: Library database,  Next: VHDL files format,  Prev: Source representation,  Up: GHDL implementation of VHDL

5.3 Library database
====================

Each design unit analyzed is placed into a design library.  By default,
the name of this design library is `work'; however, this can be changed
with the `--work=NAME' option of GHDL.

   To keep the list of design units in a design library, GHDL creates
library files.  The name of these files is `NAME-objVER.cf', where NAME
is the name of the library, and VER the VHDL version (87 or 93) used to
analyze the design units.

   You don't have to know how to read a library file.  You can display
it using the `-d' of `ghdl'.  The file contains the name of the design
units, as well as the location and the dependences.

   The format may change with the next version of GHDL.


File: ghdl.info,  Node: VHDL files format,  Next: Top entity,  Prev: Library database,  Up: GHDL implementation of VHDL

5.4 VHDL files format
=====================

VHDL has features to handle files.

   GHDL associates a file logical name (the VHDL file name) to an
operating system file name.  The logical name `STD_INPUT' is associated
to the standard input as defined by `stdin' stream of the C library,
while the logical name `STD_OUTPUT' is associated to the standard
output, as defined by the `stdout' stream of the C library.  Other
logical name are directly mapped to a file name as defined by the first
(`path') argument of the `fopen' function of the C library.  For a
binary file, the `b' character is appended to the mode argument (binary
mode).

   If multiple file objects are associated with the same external file,
a stream is created for each object, except for the standard input or
output.

   GHDL has no internal restrictions on the number of file objects that
are associated at one time with a given external file, but the
operating system may restrict the maximum number of file open at the
same time.

   For more details about these point, please refer to your operation
system documentation.

   There are two kinds of files: binary or text files.

   Text files are files of type `std.textio.text'.  The format is the
same as the format of any ascii file.  In VHDL-87, only the first 128
characters (7 bits) are allowed, since the character type has only 128
literals.  The end of line is system dependent.  Note that the stdio
functions with the text mode are used to handle text files: the fgets
function is used to read lines.  Please, refer to the manual of your C
library for more information.

   There are two kind of binary files, according to the type mark of the
file.  According to the VHDL standard, binary files must be read using
the same type they are written.

   If the type mark is a non-composite type (integer, floating type
enumeration, physical), the file is a raw stream: elements are read or
written using the same format as is used to represent the data in
memory.  This is highly non-portable, but you should be able to read
file written by a non-`GHDL' program.

   If the type mark is a composite type (record or array), the file is
composed of a 2 lines signature, followed by a raw stream.

5.5 Top entity
==============

There are some restrictions on the entity being at the apex of a design
hierarchy:

   * The generic must have a default value, and the value of a generic
     is its default value;

   * The ports type must be constrained.


File: ghdl.info,  Node: Using vendor libraries,  Next: Using ieee.math_real or ieee.math_complex,  Prev: Top entity,  Up: GHDL implementation of VHDL

5.6 Using vendor libraries
==========================

Many vendors libraries have been analyzed with GHDL.  There are usually
no problems.  Be sure to use the `--work=' option.  However, some
problems have been encountered.

   GHDL follows the VHDL LRM (the manual which defines VHDL) more
strictly than other VHDL tools.  You could try to relax the
restrictions by using the `--std=93c', `-fexplicit' and
`--warn-no-vital-generic'.

   Even with these relaxations, some broken libraries may fail.

   For example, `unisim_VITAL.vhd' from `Xilinx' can't be compiled
because lines such as:
      variable Write_A_Write_B : memory_collision_type := Write_A_Write_B;
      variable Read_A_Write_B  : memory_collision_type := Read_A_Write_B;
   (there are 6 such lines).  According to VHDL visibility rules,
`Write_A_Write_B' cannot be used while it is defined.  This is very
logical because it prevents from silly declarations such as
       constant k : natural := 2 * k;
   This files must be modified.  Fortunatly, in the example the
variables are never written.  So it is enough to remove them.


File: ghdl.info,  Node: Using ieee.math_real or ieee.math_complex,  Next: Interfacing to other languages,  Prev: Using vendor libraries,  Up: GHDL implementation of VHDL

5.7 Using ieee.math_real or ieee.math_complex
=============================================

Contrary to other `ieee' libraries, the math packages sources are not
freely available.  The sources provided with GHDL are based on an early
draft and use the C libraries.  As a consequence, you should link your
design with the `libm.a' library using the `-Wl,' option like:
     $ ghdl -e -Wl,-lm my_design
   Please, refer to your system manual for more details.

   Please also note that the `ieee' libraries are not the same as the
drafts.

   If you really need the `ieee' math libraries, they are available on
the web, but they cannot be included in GHDL.


File: ghdl.info,  Node: Interfacing to other languages,  Prev: Using ieee.math_real or ieee.math_complex,  Up: GHDL implementation of VHDL

5.8 Interfacing to other languages
==================================

Interfacing with foreign languages is possible only on GNU/Linux
systems.

   You can define a subprogram in a foreign language (such as `C' or
`Ada') and import it in a VHDL design.

5.8.1 Foreign declarations
--------------------------

Only subprograms (functions or procedures) can be imported, using the
foreign attribute.  In this example, the `sin' function is imported:

     package math is
       function sin (v : real) return real;
       attribute foreign of sin : function is "VHPIDIRECT sin";
     end math;

     package body math is
       function sin (v : real) return real is
       begin
         assert false severity failure;
       end sin;
     end math;

   A subprogram is made foreign if the FOREIGN attribute decorates it.
This attribute is declared in the 1993 revision of the `std.standard'
package.  Therefore, you cannot use this feature in VHDL 1987.

   The decoration is achived through an attribute specification.  The
attribute specification must be in the same declarative part as the
subprogram and must be after it.  This is a general rule for
specifications.  The value of the specification must be a locally
static string.

   Even when a subprogram is foreign, its body must be present.
However, since it won't be called, you can made it empty or simply but
an assertion.

   The value of the attribute must start with `VHPIDIRECT ' (an
upper-case keyword followed by one or more blanks).  The linkage name
of the subprogram follows.

5.8.2 Restrictions on foreign declarations
------------------------------------------

Any subprogram can be imported.  GHDL puts no restrictions on foreign
subprograms.  However, the representation of a type or of an interface
in a foreign language may be obscur.  Most of non-composite types are
easily imported:
`integer types'
     They are represented on a 32 bits word.  This generally
     corresponds to `int' for `C' or `Integer' for `Ada'.

`physical types'
     They are represented on a 64 bits word.  This generally
     corresponds to the `long long' for `C' or `Long_Long_Integer' for
     `Ada'.

`floating point types'
     They are represented on a 64 bits floating point word.  This
     generally corresponds to `double' for `C' or `Long_Float' for
     `Ada'.

`enumeration types'
     They are represented on 8 bits or 32 bits word, if the number of
     literals is greater than 256.  There is no corresponding C types,
     since arguments are not promoted.

   Non-composite types are passed by value.  For the `in' mode, this
corresponds to the `C' or `Ada' mechanism.  The `out' and `inout'
interfaces of non-composite types are gathered in a record and this
record is passed by reference as the first argument to the subprogram.
As a consequence, you shouldn't use `in' and `inout' modes in foreign
subprograms, since they are not portable.

   Records are represented like a `C' structure and are passed by
reference to subprograms.

   Arrays with static bounds are represented like a `C' array, whose
length is the number of elements, and are passed by reference to
subprograms.

   Unconstrained array are represented by a fat pointer.  Do not use
unconstrained arrays in foreign subprograms.

   Accesses to an unconstrained array is a fat pointer.  Other accesses
corresponds a an address and are passed to a subprogram like other
non-composite types.

   Files are represented by a 32 bits word, which corresponds to an
index in a table.

5.8.3 Linking with foreign object files
---------------------------------------

You may add additionnal files or options during the link using the
`-Wl,' of `GHDL', as described in *Note Elaboration command::.  For
example:

     $ ghdl -e -Wl,-lm math_tb
   will create the `math_tb' executable with the `lm' (mathematical)
library.

   Note the `c' library is always linked with an executable.


File: ghdl.info,  Node: Starting a simulation from a foreign program,  Next: Linking with Ada,  Prev: Linking with foreign object files,  Up: Interfacing to other languages

5.8.4 Starting a simulation from a foreign program
--------------------------------------------------

You main run your design from an external program.  You just have to
call the `ghdl_main' function which can be defined:

   in C:
     extern int ghdl_main (int argc, char **argv);

   in Ada:
     with System;
     ...
     function Ghdl_Main (Argc : Integer; Argv : System.Address)
        return Integer;
     pragma import (C, Ghdl_Main, "ghdl_main");

   This function must be called once, and returns 0 at the end of the
simulation.  In case of failure, this function does not return.  This
has to be fixed.


File: ghdl.info,  Node: Linking with Ada,  Next: Using GRT from Ada,  Prev: Starting a simulation from a foreign program,  Up: Interfacing to other languages

5.8.5 Linking with Ada
----------------------

As explained previously in *Note Starting a simulation from a foreign
program::, you can start a simulation from an `Ada' program.  However
the build process is not trivial: you have to elaborate your `Ada'
program and your `VHDL' design.

   First, you have to analyze all your design files.  In this example,
we suppose there is only one design file, `design.vhdl'.
     $ ghdl -a design.vhdl
   Then, bind your design.  In this example, we suppose the entity at
the design apex is `design'.
     $ ghdl --bind design
   Finally, compile, bind your `Ada' program at link it with your `VHDL'
design:
     $ gnatmake my_prog -largs `ghdl --list-link design`


File: ghdl.info,  Node: Using GRT from Ada,  Prev: Linking with Ada,  Up: Interfacing to other languages

5.8.6 Using GRT from Ada
------------------------

     Warning: This topic is only for advanced users knowing how to use
     `Ada' and `GNAT'.  This is provided only for reference, I have
     tested this once before releasing `GHDL' 0.19 but this is not
     checked at each release.

   The simulator kernel of `GHDL' named "GRT" is written in `Ada95' and
contains a very light and slighly adapted version of `VHPI'.  Since it
is an `Ada' implementation it is called "AVHPI". Although being tough,
you may interface to `AVHPI'.

   For using `AVHPI', you need the sources of `GHDL' and to recompile
them (at least the `GRT' library).  This library is usually compiled
with a `No_Run_Time' pragma, so that the user does not need to install
the `GNAT' run time library.  However, you certainly want to use the
usual run time library and want to avoid this pragma.  For this, reset
the GRT_PRAGMA_FLAG variable.
     $ make GRT_PRAGMA_FLAG= grt-all

   Since `GRT' is a self-contained library, you don't want `gnatlink'
to fetch individual object files (furthermore this doesn't always work
due to tricks used in `GRT').  For this, remove all the object files
and make the `.ali' files read-only.
     $ rm *.o
     $ chmod -w *.ali

   You may then install the sources files and the `.ali' files.  I have
never tested this step.

   You are now ready to use it.

   For example, here is an example, `test_grt.adb' which displays the
top level design name.
     with System; use System;
     with Grt.Avhpi; use Grt.Avhpi;
     with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;
     with Ghdl_Main;

     procedure Test_Grt is
        --  VHPI handle.
        H : VhpiHandleT;
        Status : Integer;

        --  Name.
        Name : String (1 .. 64);
        Name_Len : Integer;
     begin
        --  Elaborate and run the design.
        Status := Ghdl_Main (0, Null_Address);

        --  Display the status of the simulation.
        Put_Line ("Status is " & Integer'Image (Status));

        --  Get the root instance.
        Get_Root_Inst(H);

        --  Disp its name using vhpi API.
        Vhpi_Get_Str (VhpiNameP, H, Name, Name_Len);
        Put_Line ("Root instance name: " & Name (1 .. Name_Len));
     end Test_Grt;

   First, analyze and bind your design:
     $ ghdl -a counter.vhdl
     $ ghdl --bind counter

   Then build the whole:
     $ gnatmake test_grt -aLGRT_ALI_PATH -aIGRT_SRC_PATH -largs
      `ghdl --list-link counter`

   Finally, run your design:
     $ ./test_grt
     Status is  0
     Root instance name: counter

6.1 VITAL packages
==================

The VITAL standard or IEEE 1076.4 was first published in 1995, and
revised in 2000.

   The version of the VITAL packages depends on the VHDL standard.
VITAL 1995 packages are used with the VHDL 1987 standard, while VITAL
2000 packages are used with other standards.  This choice is based on
the requirements of VITAL: VITAL 1995 requires the models follow the
VHDL 1987 standard, while VITAL 2000 requires the models follow VHDL
1993.

   The VITAL 2000 packages were slighly modified so that they conform to
the VHDL 1993 standard (a few functions are made pure and a few one
impure).

6.2 VHDL restrictions for VITAL
===============================

The VITAL standard (partially) implemented is the IEEE 1076.4 standard
published in 1995.

   This standard defines restriction of the VHDL language usage on VITAL
model.  A "VITAL model" is a design unit (entity or architecture)
decorated by the `VITAL_Level0' or `VITAL_Level1' attribute.  These
attributes are defined in the `ieee.VITAL_Timing' package.

   Currently, only VITAL level 0 checks are implemented.  VITAL level 1
models can be analyzed, but GHDL doesn't check they comply with the
VITAL standard.

   Moreover, GHDL doesn't check (yet) that timing generics are not read
inside a VITAL level 0 model prior the VITAL annotation.

   The analysis of a non-conformant VITAL model fails.  You can disable
the checks of VITAL restrictions with the `--no-vital-checks'.  Even
when restrictions are not checked, SDF annotation can be performed.

6.3 Backannotation
==================

"Backannotation" is the process of setting VITAL generics with timing
information provided by an external files.

   The external files must be SDF (Standard Delay Format) files.  GHDL
supports a tiny subset of SDF version 2.1, other version number can be
used, provided no features added by the next version are used.

   Hierarchical instance names are not supported. However you can use a
list of instances.  If there is no instance, the top entity will be
annotated and the celltype must be the name of the top entity.  If
there is at least one instance, the last instance name must be a
component instantiation labe, and the celltype must be the name of the
component declaration instantiated.

   Instances being annotated are not required to be VITAL compliant.
However generics being annotated must follow rules of VITAL (eg, type
must be a suitable vital delay type).

   Currently, only timing constraints applying on a timing generic of
type `VitalDelayType01' has been implemented.  This SDF annotator is
just a proof of concept.  Features will be added with the following GHDL
release.

6.4 Negative constraint calculation
===================================

Negative constraint delay adjustement are necessary to handle negative
constraint such as a negative setup time.  This step is defined in the
VITAL standard and should occurs after backannotation.

   GHDL does not do negative constraint calculation.  It fails to
handle models with negative constraint.  I hope to be able to add this
phase soon.

7 Flaws and bugs report
***********************

The current version of GHDL is really a beta version.  Some features of
VHDL have not been implemented or are only partially implemented.
Besides, GHDL has not been extensively tested yet.

* Deficiencies::
* Reporting bugs::
* Future improvements::


File: ghdl.info,  Node: Deficiencies,  Next: Reporting bugs,  Prev: Flaws and bugs report,  Up: Flaws and bugs report

7.1 Deficiencies
================

Here is the non-exhaustive list of flaws:

   * So far, `GHDL' has been compiled and tested only on `i386-linux'
     systems.

   * Overflow detection is not yet implemented.

   * Some contraint checks are missing.

   * VHDL-93 is not completly implemented.

   * There are no checks for elaboration order.

   * This list is not exhaustive.

   * ...

7.2 Reporting bugs
==================

In order to improve GHDL, we welcome bugs report and suggestions for
any aspect of GHDL.  Please use the bug tracker on
<http://gna.org/projects/ghdl>.  You may also send an email to
<ghdl@free.fr>.

   If the compiler crashes, this is a bug.  Reliable tools never crash.

   If your compiled VHDL executable crashes, this may be a bug at run
time or the code produced may be wrong.  However, since VHDL has a
notion of pointers, an erroneous VHDL program (using invalid pointers
for example) may crash.

   If the compiler emits an error message for a perfectly valid input or
does not emit an error message for an invalid input, this may be a bug.
Please send the input file and what you expected.  If you know the LRM
well enough, please specify the paragraph which has not been well
implemented.  If you don't know the LRM, maybe your bug report will be
rejected simply because there is no bug.  In the latter case, it may be
difficult to discuss the issue; and comparisons with other VHDL tools
is not a very strong argument.

   If a compiler message is not clear enough for you, please tell me.
The error messages can be improved, but I have not enough experience
with them.

   If you have found a mistake in the manual, please send a comment.  If
you have not understood some parts of this manual, please tell me.
English is not my mother tongue, so this manual may not be well-written.
Again, rewriting part of it is a good way to improve it.

   If you send a `VHDL' file producing a bug, it is a good idea to try
to make it as short as possible.  It is also a good idea to make it
looking like a test: write a comment which explains wether the file
should compile, and if yes, whether or not it should run successfully.
In the latter case, an assert statement should finish the test; the
severity level note indicates success, while a severity level failure
indicates failure.

   For bug reports, please include enough information for the
maintainers to reproduce the problem. This includes:

   * the version of `GHDL' (you can get it with `ghdl --version').

   * the operating system

   * whether you have built `GHDL' from sources or used the binary
     distribution.

   * the content of the input files

   * a description of the problem and samples of any erroneous input

   * anything else that you think would be helpful.

7.3 Future improvements
=======================

I have several axes for `GHDL' improvements:
   * Documentation.

   * Better diagnostics messages (warning and error).

   * Full support of VHDL-87 and VHDL-93.

   * Support of VHDL-02.

   * Optimization (simulation speed).

   * Graphical tools (to see waves and to debug)

   * Style checks

   * VITAL acceleration
